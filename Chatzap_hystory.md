## Presentation

I Want to present the product ChatZAP for Deliveries, the tool that helps you automate customer service via whatsapp messages.

More than 95% of people uses whatsapp for everyday things, and when asking for food, it's not different.

restaurants have problems with: 

- high volume messages
- lack of responses to customers
- wrong order annotation
- delivery delayed due to not organized flow
- payment checks not consistent

with this in mind i want to present for you ChatZAP Delivery, a solution to automate customer service, orders, deliveries and payments for your delivery

It's simple to start using

Add a name of your restaurant and go:
This is the home page, where you check the orders and simply move the orders on columns when a new status for that order is changed, every change in the order updates the customer via whatsapp message, informing the new status
When finished it goes to the delivery guy who picks up the order, and when he picks up the order a new message is sent to customer

Cool right, customers tend to turn anxious without updates, not with chatzap delivery

Now to simplify things we added a innovative approach when you add your menu for the first time, you upload your menu and an AI read and interpret the menu, and display a page with the items and categories he found in your menu, when you hit save, it adds the categories and products to your database and is ready for customers purchase.

You can edit every item easily, change price, add optionals, make a promotion

Additionally every restaurant has his strategies and rules, too, and we have a lot of that in the strategy menu, we have:

- General strategies, where you define simple things like minimum purchase, discounts on big orders, free delivery fee and more
- vouchers, where you can create and send via whatsapp vouchers for your customers
- loyalty program, as your customers purchase more, they gain more points and discount vouchers 
- launchs, where you can launch a new product it keeps it highlighted for a period
- promotions, you can add promotions discount per value or percent any product

Look now at the messaging, the customer sends an hi and the chatbot responds almost instantly, in the Standard version the chatbot have prepared instructions via code to respond the customers, and in the premium version an AI respond all queries.

Look the menu for the customer it's easy and with a few clicks we can make an order, and look the payment system, we have integrated with major players such as Stripe and Pagseguro, look this pix payment, i add my place to deliver, select pix and finish look, the pix code, now i will pay and voila.

a message confirming my order was paid and your restaurant will take care

Now at your side in the home page, you receive alerts via message and dashboard, check a new order has come, you can accept or not depending the address, if not accept, the system instantly charges back the customer.

Then you can follow the flow

Now the new and big difference of chatzap among others, we have a new feature, people love to send audio messages, and why we cant handle that ? 

Yes we can ! if a customer send an audio we send to Openai Whisper api, who reads the audio, and send to GPT-4 with the restaurant rules and menu, so GPT 4 makes an accurate response to the customer, the proccess is maximum of 3-4 seconds, very fast and it check everything and mount the order of the customer, when the customer wants to close the order it simply speak his address and the system detects to close the order, AI close the order, send to restaurant, send a message to customer informing the order is done, all via AI.

This is a innovative approach we never see this kind of integration with ai from other competitors such as ifood, ze delivery or others.
