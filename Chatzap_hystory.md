Today i'm presenting to you ChatZAP Delivery

A software platform that automates your restaurant’s orders, payments, and deliveries, all through WhatsApp.

Why WhatsApp? Because more than 95% of customers in Brazil use it every day, and food ordering is no exception.

But restaurants often struggle with too many incoming messages, slow responses, wrong orders, and payment confusion. We use the most advanced AI tools available today like , GPT-4, Whisper-AI, RAG(RAG é mais machine learning do que IA ?), payment integrations with the biggest players on the market such as Stripe and PagSeguro

All of this technology is hidden behind the scenes. The restaurant owner doesn’t need to know about AI models or APIs — they just see an easy interface that works, whether they are beginners or advanced users.

Whanna see ?

First you are on the dashboard page, the orders page, Look at the whatsapp icon in GREEN, it indicates whatsapp is connected and serving customers

Then we have 3 main states in the dashboard indicating the status order of the customers
The first column is when the order arrives, you simply

- click on the order
- check the name, phone, address and the items
- and you can print the order cancel the order or move the card to other state When you start the order,

simply drag and drop the card to the preparing column, the system will send a message to the customer

look then When the order is finished, drag the card to Completed. The customer instantly receives a message that their order is ready, and the delivery staff is also notified to pick it up.

check here the delivery guy app, he can see the order id, the addres and can pick up the delivery check the map distance and also mark as delivered when finished, when he clicks on pick up, a message is sent to the customer after he finishes the deliver the card is marked as delivered automatic updated in your dashboard

easy right ?

Every restaurant has its own unique menu, and adding dozens of items to a new system can be very time-consuming.

We solved that with AI. Here, the restaurant simply uploads a PDF or an image of the menu. The system automatically analyzes it, detects all items, categories, and prices, and shows a preview list. With one click on Save, all those items are added to the database.

The update is immediate — customers can see the new menu instantly, and the AI uses the updated information in every interaction.

From this page, you can also edit items — name, description, price — and even set promotions. Just click Promotion, choose a value or percentage discount, and it’s applied instantly.

So what used to take hours now takes just a few minutes, with zero complexity for the restaurant owner.

Another cool feature is the Strategy Page.
Here the restaurant can define business rules like a minimum purchase, free delivery fee, or even cashback on the first order.

They can also send coupons, create loyalty programs, highlight new products, and set promotions.

I won’t go into each option in detail, but the idea is simple: these tools help restaurants increase sales, reward loyal customers, and run campaigns easily — all from one place.

# Home page

It's simple to start using

Just type your restaurant name, and you’re ready to start:
This is the home page, first check If the WhatsApp icon is green, it means the connection is active and customers will get instant auto-replies.,

Now the dashboard where you check the orders and Simply drag orders across columns like Received, Preparing, Ready, and each move sends an automatic update to the customer.

When finished it goes to the delivery guy who picks up the order, and when he picks up the order a new message is sent to customer

And it works smoothly on tablets and phones too, so staff can manage orders even on the go.

Cool right, customers tend to turn anxious without updates, not with chatzap delivery

# Menu page

Now to simplify things we added a innovative approach when you add your menu for the first time, you upload your menu and an AI read and interpret the menu, and display a page with the items and categories he found in your menu, when you hit save, it adds the categories and products to your database and is ready for customers purchase.

You can edit every item easily, change price, add optionals, make a promotion

# Whatsapp messaging

Look now at the messaging, the customer sends an hi and the chatbot responds almost instantly, in the Standard version the chatbot have prepared instructions via code to respond the customers, and in the premium version an AI respond all queries.

# Online menu - Standard Version

Look the menu for the customer it's easy and with a few clicks we can make an order, and look the payment system, we have integrated with major players such as Stripe and Pagseguro, look this pix payment, i add my place to deliver, select pix and finish look, the pix code, now i will pay and voila.

a message confirming my order was paid and your restaurant will take care

Now at your side in the home page, you receive alerts via message and dashboard, check a new order has come, you can accept or not depending the address, if not accept, the system instantly charges back the customer.

Then you can follow the flow

# Full Ai ordering with audio

Now the new and big difference of chatzap among others, we have a new feature, people love to send audio messages, and why we cant handle that ?

Yes we can ! When a customer sends a voice message, our system uses AI to first transcribe the audio (so we know exactly what was said), and then another AI (GPT-4) understands the request based on the restaurant’s rules and menu. In just 3–4 seconds, the system builds the order and confirms it back to the customer.

This is a innovative approach we never see this kind of integration with ai from other competitors in the market.

# Strategy page

## New approach

On the strategy page, restaurants can set rules like discounts on big orders, loyalty points, or launch promotions for new products. Everything is managed in just a few clicks.

## Old approach

Additionally every restaurant has his strategies and rules, too, and we have a lot of that in the strategy menu, we have:

- General strategies, where you define simple things like minimum purchase, discounts on big orders, free delivery fee and more
- vouchers, where you can create and send via whatsapp vouchers for your customers
- loyalty program, as your customers purchase more, they gain more points and discount vouchers
- launchs, where you can launch a new product it keeps it highlighted for a period
- promotions, you can add promotions discount per value or percent any product
