## Initial presentation

“Hi, my name is Rafael, and today I want to show you ChatZAP Delivery.
It’s a platform I built that helps restaurants automate orders, payments, and deliveries — all directly through WhatsApp.

Why WhatsApp? Because more than 95% of customers in Brazil use it every day, and food ordering is no exception.
But restaurants often struggle with too many incoming messages, slow responses, wrong orders, and payment confusion.

ChatZAP Delivery solves these problems in a very simple way: it turns WhatsApp into a complete ordering and payment system, powered by automation and AI. And today I’ll show you exactly how it works step by step.”

## Presentation

I Want to present the product ChatZAP for Deliveries, the tool that helps you automate customer service via whatsapp messages.

More than 95% of people uses whatsapp for everyday things, and when asking for food, it's not different.

restaurants have problems with:

- high volume messages
- lack of responses to customers
- wrong order annotation
- delivery delayed due to not organized flo=
- payment checks not consistent

with this in mind i want to present for you ChatZAP Delivery, a solution to automate customer service, orders, deliveries and payments for your delivery

# Home page

It's simple to start using

Just type your restaurant name, and you’re ready to start:
This is the home page, first check If the WhatsApp icon is green, it means the connection is active and customers will get instant auto-replies.,

Now the dashboard where you check the orders and Simply drag orders across columns like Received, Preparing, Ready, and each move sends an automatic update to the customer.

When finished it goes to the delivery guy who picks up the order, and when he picks up the order a new message is sent to customer

And it works smoothly on tablets and phones too, so staff can manage orders even on the go.

Cool right, customers tend to turn anxious without updates, not with chatzap delivery

# Menu page

Now to simplify things we added a innovative approach when you add your menu for the first time, you upload your menu and an AI read and interpret the menu, and display a page with the items and categories he found in your menu, when you hit save, it adds the categories and products to your database and is ready for customers purchase.

You can edit every item easily, change price, add optionals, make a promotion

# Whatsapp messaging

Look now at the messaging, the customer sends an hi and the chatbot responds almost instantly, in the Standard version the chatbot have prepared instructions via code to respond the customers, and in the premium version an AI respond all queries.

# Online menu - Standard Version

Look the menu for the customer it's easy and with a few clicks we can make an order, and look the payment system, we have integrated with major players such as Stripe and Pagseguro, look this pix payment, i add my place to deliver, select pix and finish look, the pix code, now i will pay and voila.

a message confirming my order was paid and your restaurant will take care

Now at your side in the home page, you receive alerts via message and dashboard, check a new order has come, you can accept or not depending the address, if not accept, the system instantly charges back the customer.

Then you can follow the flow

# Full Ai ordering with audio

Now the new and big difference of chatzap among others, we have a new feature, people love to send audio messages, and why we cant handle that ?

Yes we can ! When a customer sends a voice message, our system uses AI to first transcribe the audio (so we know exactly what was said), and then another AI (GPT-4) understands the request based on the restaurant’s rules and menu. In just 3–4 seconds, the system builds the order and confirms it back to the customer.

This is a innovative approach we never see this kind of integration with ai from other competitors in the market.

# Strategy page

## New approach

On the strategy page, restaurants can set rules like discounts on big orders, loyalty points, or launch promotions for new products. Everything is managed in just a few clicks.

## Old approach

Additionally every restaurant has his strategies and rules, too, and we have a lot of that in the strategy menu, we have:

- General strategies, where you define simple things like minimum purchase, discounts on big orders, free delivery fee and more
- vouchers, where you can create and send via whatsapp vouchers for your customers
- loyalty program, as your customers purchase more, they gain more points and discount vouchers
- launchs, where you can launch a new product it keeps it highlighted for a period
- promotions, you can add promotions discount per value or percent any product

# Final punch

In short, ChatZAP Delivery turns WhatsApp into a complete sales channel — orders, payments, updates, even audio messages handled by AI. It reduces mistakes, saves time, and boosts restaurant revenue. That’s how we bring AI into real life, solving everyday problems for business owners
